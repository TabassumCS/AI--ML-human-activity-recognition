# Human Activity Recognition Using LSTM and LRCN

This project was developed as part of my undergraduate **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** module. It focuses on classifying human activities from video data using deep learning models: **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks and a **CNN-LSTM hybrid (LRCN)**.

## ðŸš€ Project Features

- Frame extraction and preprocessing from video clips
- LSTM model for temporal feature learning
- LRCN (CNN + LSTM) model for spatiotemporal recognition
- Accuracy and loss visualization
- Performance comparison between both models
